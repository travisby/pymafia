25-33% mafia
<=13  players, 1 cop, no more than 2 informative roles
2 masons = 1 informative role
if cop and doctor, mafia roleblocker needed
1/2 town power roles == too many
1/4 town power roles == need mafia power roles



Consider what would happen if the town mass-claimed day 1. Assume one scum claims doctor or tracker, and the others claim townie. Does the town have a really good strategy to help them win? If they do, put in some way for the scum to stop it.
Look at how fast the town can clear people. Masons are automatically cleared. Cops and most other info roles clear one person per day. Assume the scum never kill an info role or cleared player, and no player is cleared twice; how long will it tak
